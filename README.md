# Micron+ AWD Minilith gantry

## Drive configurations:
there is only an AWD 6mm belt configuration as of now.

## Toolheads
Since this gantry has reversed belts, I kept Monoliths belt spacing for better toolhead support.
Any toolhead with a dedicated Monolith MGN9H carriage should fit on this gantry. 

## Futur Plans
- Update to RC1 Monolith
- 2WD version
- PFA belt spacing for better fitment (so custom toolhead mounts)
- Fix the random hights on the parts.
- Sheet metal version
- Potentially a Salad fork version 

## Downsides
- Z-chain relocation or Z-umbilical is needed
- loss of X travel depending on the toolhead
- Small build volume loss on the front corners. (worse if you use klicky probe)
- A lot louder than 2WD.

## Acknowledgement
I want to thank:
- **CloakedWayne** I can't state this enough, all props goes to CloakedWayne, he designed and put all the effort in designing this gantry.
- **Hartk** For making the incredible Micron and starting me out in a spiral downhill of Vorons / DIY 3D printers.

> **I have a user project in the server where you can ask questions!**
> **Maybe other users might be able to help you seeing as functionnality and belt path is basically the same**
